# Schoolendar

Schoolendar is basically a calendar designed to help students organise their work. This tool is the perfect choice for groups, where every member can look through already added events and create his own event like exam or homework that is available for other users. We focuse on clarity and concisness of interface. 

#### In the future we want to add:
- Connection with Google Calendar and school diary APIs
- Integration with [Que](https://github.com/Que-App)
- Possibility to fully customise (themes, icons, events types, etc.)
 
  

#### This project is only for learning purpose.
